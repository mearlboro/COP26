Prior to working on data science related to climate change information, our group has contributed to pioneering work on the spreading of misinformation online ([article](https://www.pnas.org/content/113/3/554){:target="_blank"} / [media coverage](https://pnas.altmetric.com/details/4951559){:target="_blank"}), the Covid-19 infodemic ([article](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-73510-5){:target="_blank"} / [media coverage](https://nature.altmetric.com/details/91846881){:target="_blank"}), climate adaptation ([article](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab304d){:target="_blank"}), and the formation of social norms ([article](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.aas8827){:target="_blank"} / [media coverage](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-25-revolution-how-big-does-a-minority-have-to-be-to-reshape-society/){:target="_blank"}).
